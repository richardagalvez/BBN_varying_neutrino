# BBN with varying neutrino temperature and number. 

This repo is meant to provide the source code used in [Cosmology with Independently Varying Neutrino Temperature and Number](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06351) plus some example numerical analysis on the results of the simulation.

The simulation program was modified by [K. Hickerson's](https://github.com/hickerson) [version 1.6 of AlterBBN](https://github.com/hickerson/bbn) which was originally written by [A. Arbey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1363) .
